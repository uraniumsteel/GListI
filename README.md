GListI
======

List Manager, To Do's, etc.  Multi level
Uses JQuery, JQuery UI (with sortable) and nestedsortable.js plugin by https://github.com/mjsarfatti/nestedSortable
Lists are each a flat json file in a 'lists' subfolder

2012-02-28: Right now there is only one login: admin admin

*The Plan*
1. Hook into a MySQL database for login username & password. With an admin screen to administer
2. Allowing sharing of lists between users specified by a username or email list.
3. Fixup some of the list handling (long list of stuff here)
4. Store the lists in MySQL instead of flat files.
